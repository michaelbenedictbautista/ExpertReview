				<h4>About Us</h4>
				<p class="text-break">Expert Review is your go-to guide for eating out and eating in. 
												We are the number one destination for credible, independent restaurant, bar and cafe reviews 
												and bring you the latest in food news across Au stralia and the globe.</p><br>

				<h4>Reputation matters</h4>
				<p class="text-break">Businesses earn great reviews on Expert Reviews the same way they 
												build their reputations in the community: by creating great products, services, and 
												customer experiences. Expert Reviews work hard to feature content that reflects real 
												experiences that consumers are inspired to share.
				</p><br>
				<h4>Authenticity & reliability</h4>
				<p class="text-break">Under Expert Reviewsâ€™ policies, businesses are not permitted to ask 
												their customers for reviews, and consumers can only write about their first-hand experiences. 
												We also use an automated recommendation software, which is designed to identify and 
												recommend the most reliable content.
				</p><br>
				<h4>Fighting misinformation</h4>
				<p class="text-break">Fake news and deceptive behaviour 
												are unfortunately common on the web. We have teams and policies in place to 
												protect our community of consumers and businesses and prevent the spread of misinformation 
												on Expert Reviews.
					<br><br>
					Our users have contributed over 200 million reviews of almost every type 
												of restaurant. Our business revolves around the connections made between the consumers who 
												read and write reviews and the local businesses that they describe.
					<br><br>
					Here we will provide you with only interesting content, which you will like very much. We're dedicated to providing 
												you with the best restaurant reviews with a focus on dependability and quality. We're working 
												to turn our passion for reviews into a booming online website. We hope you enjoy our Expert 
												Review restaurants website as much as we enjoy offering them to you.
